- I added metal versions of mini chests, they all still have one slot, they can be crafted by surrounding an expanded storage wooden chest with 3 paper and puttin the respective material on top, e.g. for iron you use an iron ingot, obsidian: an obsidian block.
- Yes I did this all in a day... I don't even know how...
