# 8.1.0-beta.2

---
- Added Mini barrels :D
- **TODO:** Added Moss chests and minecarts. Thanks to ClockworkVulpine for the textures!
- **TODO:** Added chest locks:
  - Gold locks can be open by keys with the same name as the lock.
  - Diamond locks can only be opened by the player who placed it.
- Declare breaks with Ellemes' Container Library, it's now included, you must remove it from your mods folder otherwise it will conflict.
- Chest minecarts now preserve their name when upgraded or having their theme swapped.
- Chests can now be retrieved from chest minecarts by breaking them whilst sneaking.
- Copper blocks no longer show if they are waxed or not in the inventory screen (names were getting too long)
- All chests now face the same way; some have tweaked first person rendering too.
- **TODO:** Removed unused assets and code
- Made Conversion Kits and Storage Mutator consistent between entities and blocks.
- Made Conversion Kit and Storage Mutator usage delay longer.
