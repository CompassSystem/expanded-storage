This mod adds new storage containers. Namely: chests, old chests, barrels and mini chests.

All but the mini chests are like vanilla containers but can store more items.

For recipes please use a recipe viewing mod like [EMI](https://modrinth.com/mod/emi) or [REI](https://modrinth.com/mod/roughly-enough-items).

Below is more detailed information regarding the mod however please note not all tiers / themes are available for all storage types.

<summary>Modelled chests</summary>
<img src="https://gitlab.com/Ellemes/expanded-storage/-/raw/documentation/art/descriptions/png/Modelled%20chests_512.png" alt="Picture of modelled chests" />
<hr/>
Modelled chests act identical to vanilla chests however can generally hold more items.
<br/>
<br/>
They can also merge vertically and horizontally in the long direction to form tall and long chests in addition to vanilla's double chest (wide chest) and single chest.

<details>
<summary>Old chests</summary>
<img src="https://gitlab.com/Ellemes/expanded-storage/-/raw/documentation/art/descriptions/png/Full%20cube%20chests_512.png" alt="Picture of old chests" />
<hr/>
Old chests are like the modelled chest in visuals however occupy the whole block and do not have any kind of opening animation.
These may be better for you than modelled chests as not having a block entity renderer meaning they will have less impact on your fps.

<details>
<summary>Barrels</summary>
<img src="https://gitlab.com/Ellemes/expanded-storage/-/raw/documentation/art/descriptions/png/Barrels_512.png" alt="Picture of barrels" />
<hr/>
Barrels like full cube chests don't have a block entity renderer, so they will result in better fps over the modelled chests if you have a bunch of them in one area, otherwise they are functionally identical to vanilla barrels just with more inventory space.

<details>
<summary>Mini chests</summary>
<img src="https://gitlab.com/Ellemes/expanded-storage/-/raw/documentation/art/descriptions/png/Mini%20chests_512.png" alt="Picture of mini chests" />
<hr/>
Mini chests are chest but mini, they all can only hold 1 item and are ideal for gifting things to other players :D
<br/>
<br/>

Note: not all styles are craft-able and will need a Storage Mutator renamed to `Sunrise` or `Sparrow` to unlock.

<details>
<summary>Tools</summary>
<img src="https://gitlab.com/Ellemes/expanded-storage/-/raw/documentation/art/descriptions/png/Tools_512.png" alt="Picture of the storage mutator" />
<hr/>

The storage mutator is a tool to configure chest and other storage containers in world.
It currently consists of 4 modes, note not all modes are applicable to all storage types:
- Merge: Allows merging of two adjacent chests or old chests into a double chest.
- Split: Allows splitting a double chest into two single chests.
- Rotate: Allows rotating any storage container, note chests are limited to horizontal rotations.
- Swap theme: Allows changing the theme of the storage container. (only Expanded Storage ones)

<summary>Conversion kits</summary>

<hr/>
Conversion kits can be used to convert blocks already in world to a different tier.
<br/>
Whilst only some conversion kits are pictured above others do exist for example wooden to netherite conversion kit.
