# Old chests

Old chests are like the modelled chest in visuals however occupy the whole block and do not have any kind of opening animation. These may be better for you than modelled chests as not having a block entity renderer mean they have less impact on your fps.<br/><br/>For tier information see modelled chests.
# Barrels

Barrels like full cube chests don't have a block entity renderer so they will result in better fps over the modelled chests if you have a bunch of them in one area, otherwise they are functionally identical to vanilla barrels just with more inventory space.<br/><br/>For tier information see modelled chests.
# Mini chests

Mini chests are chest but mini, they all can only hold 1 item and are ideal for gifting things to other players :D
